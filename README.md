Hey! I finally finished this Netflix clone (took me more time than I expected ðŸ˜…). My idea was to make everything static (movies, series, tv shows, ...) but then I found this really cool TMDB API which you can pull most popular movies, top rated shows, what's trending, collections, lists and muuuch more. Really worth checking the effort made.
